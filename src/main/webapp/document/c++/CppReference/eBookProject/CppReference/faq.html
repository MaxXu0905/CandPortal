      <H1>Frequently Asked Questions</H1>
      <H3>Can I get a copy of this site?</H3>We do provide <A 
      href="cppreference-files.tar.gz">a 
      downloadable archived version of cppreference.com</A>. If you're 
      interested in getting archived versions of websites in general, you might 
      want to check out utilities like <A 
      href="http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/wget.html">GNU's wget</A> (Windows 
      version <A 
      href="http://www.interlog.com/~tcharron/wgetwin.html">here</A>). 
      <H3>Can I translate this site to some other language?</H3>Sure, that would 
      be great! All that we would ask is that you include a link back to this 
      site so that people know where to get the most up-to-date content. 
      <H3>Who is this site meant for?</H3>There are no "Introduction to 
      Programming" tutorials here. This site is meant to be used by more-or-less 
      experienced C++ programmers, who have a good idea of what they want to do 
      and simply need to look up the syntax. If you're interested in learning 
      C/C++, try one of these sites: 
      <UL>
        <LI><A href="http://www.howstuffworks.com/c.htm">How C Programming 
        Works</A> 
        <LI><A href="http://www.its.strath.ac.uk/courses/c">C Programming</A> 
        <LI><A href="http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/">C++ Language 
        Tutorial</A> </LI></UL>
      <H3>Does this site contain a complete and definitive list of C/C++ 
      functions?</H3>Few things in life are absolute. If you don't find what you 
      are looking for here, don't assume that it doesn't exist. Do a search on 
      <A href="http://www.google.com/">Google</A> for it. 
      <H3>Some of the examples on this site don't work on my system. What's 
      going on?</H3>Most of the code on this site was compiled under <A 
      href="http://www.linux.com/">Linux</A> (<A 
      href="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat</A>, <A 
      href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A>, or <A 
      href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</A>) with the <A 
      href="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU</A> <A 
      href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/gcc.html">Compiler Collection</A>. 
      Since this site is merely a reference for the <A 
      href="http://www.ncits.org/cplusplus.htm">Standard C and C++ 
      specification</A>, not every compiler will support every function listed 
      here. For example, 
      <UL><!-- <LI>I've never had much luck getting 
                  <A HREF="cppbitset.html">C++ Bitsets</A>
                  to work on my computer - but they're listed here.  not needed now -->
        <LI>Header files change like mad. To include the necessary support for 
        <A href="cppvector/index.html">C++ 
        Vectors</A>, you might have to use any of these: <PRE class=example-code>  #include &lt;vector&gt;
  #include &lt;Vector&gt;
  #include &lt;vector.h&gt;
</PRE>(according to the spec, the first of those should work, and the 
        compiler should know enough to use it to reference the real vector 
        header file.) 
        <LI>Another header file issue is that newer compilers can use a more 
        platform-independent commands to include standard C libraries. For 
        example, you might be able to use <PRE class=example-code>  #include &lt;cstdio&gt;
</PRE>instead of <PRE class=example-code>  #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
</PRE>
        <LI>All of the code on this site assumes that the correct namespace has 
        been designated. If your compiler is a little old, then you might be 
        able to get away with using simple statements like: <PRE class=example-code>  cout &lt;&lt; "hello world!";
</PRE>However, newer compilers require that you either use <PRE class=example-code>  std::cout &lt;&lt; "hello world!";
</PRE>or declare what namespace to use with the "using namespace" 
        command. 
        <LI>Certain popular compilers (like the one shipped with Microsoft's 
        Visual C++) have added alternative or additional functionality to the 
        C++ Standard Template Library. For example, the MFC in Visual C++ 
        provides you with the string type "CString", which has string 
        functionality but is not part of the C++ STL. </LI></UL>...The list goes 
      on and on. In other words, individual results may vary. 
      <H3>You've got an error in this site.</H3>If you find any errors in this 
      reference, please feel free to <A 
      href="mailto:comments@cppreference.com">contact us</A> -- feedback and 
      code examples are always welcome. 
      <H3>What's up with this site?</H3>Think of it as a community service, for 
      geeks. </DIV></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
