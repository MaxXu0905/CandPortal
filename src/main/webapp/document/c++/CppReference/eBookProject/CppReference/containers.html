      Containers </DIV>
      <H1>C++ Containers</H1>The C++ Containers (vectors, lists, etc.) are 
      generic vessels capable of holding many different types of data. For 
      example, the following statement creates a <A 
      href="cppvector/index.html">vector</A> of 
      integers: <PRE>vector&lt;int&gt; v;
</PRE>Containers can hold standard objects (like the <STRONG>int</STRONG> 
      in the above example) as well as custom objects, as long as the objects in 
      the container meet a few requirements: 
      <UL>
        <LI>The object must have a default constructor, 
        <LI>an accessible destructor, and 
        <LI>an accessible assignment operator. </LI></UL>When describing the 
      functions associated with these various containers, this website defines 
      the word <STRONG>TYPE</STRONG> to be the object type that the container 
      holds. For example, in the above statement, <STRONG>TYPE</STRONG> would be 
      <STRONG>int</STRONG>. Similarily, when referring to containers associated 
      with pairs of data (<A 
      href="cppmap/index.html">map</A> for example) 
      <STRONG>key_type</STRONG> and <STRONG>value_type</STRONG> are used to 
      refer to the key and value types for that container.
